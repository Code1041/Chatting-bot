# Chatting-bot
This is a C++ based working chatbot!
It covers a small portion of C++ depending upon how much the Information is uploaded in the Main.txt file.
It Can interpret what the user is asking!
For Example:

Enter your Question: waht are loosp?
A loop is the repetition of...............

Enter your Question: wtha rae loops!
A loop is the repetition of..............

It only takes the keyword and removes all the other words (like waht,rea) and symbols(like ?,:"|*&)
After removing other words, it then compares the spelling (arrangement of Characters) of the keyword with the correct keyword from the Spelling.txt file
After comparing, it takes the correct keyword from the file Spelling.txt and then searches for it in Main.txt file.
Finally, User gets its answer!

Also, It Can Speak alongwith chatting!

It ignores Grammatical mistakes and spelling mistakes which makes it Unique (Just like AI models)
But the keyword in the Question must have different arrangement of characters.
It should not have any missing character or a wrong one!

For Example:
"loosp" not "lossp" and "aarrys" not "arrys"!
